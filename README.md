#  Shopper Spectrum: E-Commerce Customer Segmentation & Recommendation Engine

## 📌 Problem Statement

In the highly competitive e-commerce landscape, businesses often struggle with customer retention and stagnant Average Order Values (AOV) due to "one-size-fits-all" marketing. Without understanding distinct purchasing behaviors, marketing budgets are wasted, and revenue is left on the table.

**Shopper Spectrum** solves this by analyzing raw e-commerce transactional data to build two Unsupervised Machine Learning systems:

1. **A Customer Segmentation Model** to group buyers into actionable personas (e.g., "High-Value" vs. "At-Risk") for targeted marketing.

2. **A Product Recommendation Engine** to automatically suggest "Frequently Bought Together" items, directly increasing AOV.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow & Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing & NLP

* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing Customer IDs, removed negative quantities (cancellations), duplicate records, and engineered standard transactional features.

* **Outlier Treatment:** Applied 95th-percentile capping to extreme wholesale (B2B) buyers to prevent cluster distortion.

* **NLP on Catalog:** Utilized Natural Language Processing (Regex, Stopword Removal, and Lemmatization) to standardize thousands of noisy, manually entered product descriptions.

---

### 2. Customer Segmentation (RFM + K-Means)

* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated **R**ecency (days since last purchase), **F**requency (total purchases), and **M**onetary (total spend) for every customer.

* **Data Transformation:** Applied Log Transformation (`log1p`) and Standard Scaling to reduce skewness and improve clustering performance.

* **Algorithm:** Applied **K-Means Clustering** to the transformed RFM matrix.

* **Optimization:** Built a custom Grid Search loop evaluated via the **Silhouette Score** and tested multiple cluster configurations.

* **Segments Identified:**

  * 💎 High-Value Customers
  * 🛒 Regular Customers
  * 🤔 Occasional Customers
  * 📉 At-Risk Customers

---

### 3. Product Recommendation Engine (Collaborative Filtering)

* **Matrix Creation:** Built a sparse Item-User matrix mapping products to customer purchase quantities.

* **Algorithm:** Implemented **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering.

* **Optimization:** Evaluated multiple distance metrics including:

  * Cosine Similarity
  * Euclidean Distance
  * Manhattan Distance

* **Best Model:** Cosine Similarity produced the strongest recommendation quality for sparse e-commerce purchase data.

* **Output:** Returns the Top 5 most relevant products based on customer purchase behavior.

---

### 4. Deployment

* Serialized optimized models using Joblib:

  * `kmeans_model.joblib`
  * `rfm_scaler.joblib`
  * `knn_recommender.joblib`

* Saved recommendation assets:

  * `pivot_table.pkl`

* Built an interactive, real-time web application using **Streamlit**.
